# Calculus II

***
## Course Information
* Calculus II (UoG11014.06)
* This is an English taught course for first-year undergraduate students.
* This course extends the basic operation skills of calculus to infinite series, differential calculus for multivariable functions, integral calculus for multivariable functions, and integration of multi-vector valued functions.
* Teaching QQ group (slides, lecture notes): 949748117 


### Purpose of the Course:
The aim of this course is to ensure that students are competent in higher mathematics encountered throughout engineering, particularly functions of more than one variable, including both theory and extensive practice.


#### Requirements by the end of this course:
* apply calculus to parametric functions and vector-valued functions; understand the inner and cross products of vectors, and apply them to lines and planes in space; introduce polar coordinates and related equations;
* calculate partial derivatives, total differential and high-order partial derivatives of multivariable functions; find the derivative of implicit functions;
* explain the concepts of directional derivative and gradient and calculate them in two and three dimensions; apply partial derivatives to find the tangent plane and normal line of a surface; locate extreme values of a multivariable function, both unconstrained and under given conditions, and apply the Lagrange multiplier method;
* describe the meaning of double integrals (Cartesian coordinates and Polar coordinates) and evaluate them; similarly for triple integral (Cartesian coordinates, Cylindrical coordinates and Spherical coordinates);
* explain the definition of line integrals for scalar-valued functions and vector fields, be aware that the results of a line integral depends on the path in general; determine that a line integral is independent of path in conservative fields;
* apply Green’s theorem to integrals in the plane; express given surfaces in an appropriate form and evaluate surface integrals over surfaces; apply the theorems of Green, Gauss and Stokes to line, surface and volume integrals and explain their significance in engineering;
* state what is meant by a sequence and series, find limits of sequence; apply criteria for convergence of series with terms of the same sign or alternating sign; distinguish between absolute convergence and conditional convergence; establish conditions for convergence of power series, other functional series and Taylor series; derive Maclaurin expansions of elementary transcendental functions such as sin(x) and cos(x); apply direct and indirect expansion methods of some simple functions to applications of power series in approximate calculations.
