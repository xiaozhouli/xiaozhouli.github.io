excerpt: 'This project develops advanced filtering techniques to enhance the smoothness and accuracy quality of high-order discontinuous Galerkin simulation data.'
---
High-order Galerkin methods—both discontinuous and continuous—are known for their strong theoretical foundations and computational efficiency. However, a common limitation stems from their minimal smoothness requirements across element interfaces. This lack of continuity can undermine downstream tasks such as data interpretation, feature detection, and scientific visualization, where smoothness is often crucial.

This project seeks to enhance the utility of Galerkin-based simulations by developing filters that simultaneously improve smoothness and maintain accuracy. These techniques will be designed to align with the mathematical structure of the computed data while producing outputs that are more compatible with conventional visualization workflows.

The core aim is to explore and resolve fundamental challenges in visualizing outputs from high-order discontinuous Galerkin simulations. To that end, we will advance the theory and implementation of Smoothness-Increasing Accuracy-Conserving (SIAC) filters and deliver robust, accessible software tools tailored to the needs of researchers and practitioners working with high-fidelity numerical simulations.
