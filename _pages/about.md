Welcome! I’m **Xiaozhou Li (李小舟)** — an applied mathematician with a background in high-order numerical methods, scientific computing, and mathematical modeling. My research focuses on the numerical solution of partial differential equations, with particular interest in discontinuous Galerkin methods, superconvergence theory, and large-scale simulations powered by high-performance computing.

I approach mathematics not only as a language of structure and precision, but also as a discipline of thought that shapes how we model, simulate, and ultimately understand the complex world.
