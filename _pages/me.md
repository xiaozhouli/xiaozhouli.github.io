Xiaozhou Li (李小舟) was born in Chongqing, China. I received my B.Sc. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), where I also minored in Mathematical Economics, and later earned my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. 

My academic work centers on computational mathematics—especially high-order numerical methods and large-scale scientific computing—where abstract ideas take shape as algorithms, and logic becomes a quiet craft for understanding the intricate world around us.

Beyond the university, I am drawn to the steady disciplines of strength training and the science of longevity. For years, I have practiced barbell-based training and more recently begun studying Mixed Martial Arts (MMA). These pursuits cultivate focus, clarity, and patience—virtues as essential in the gym as they are in mathematics.

They mirror the core principles of mathematical work: discipline, incremental progress, and the quiet resolve to pursue distant goals over time.

Just as strength training gradually shapes the body, I see mathematics as a long discipline of the mind—one that sharpens how we observe, reason, and build. It reminds me to stay rooted in the process rather than fixated on outcomes, and to trust in the slow, steady accumulation of insight.
