## Research Interests:
* Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Method and its variations, especially for hyperbolic PDEs and in general convection dominated problems.
* Numerical analysis of time discretization methods, especially for PDEs.
* Numerical methods for nonlinear wave propagation problems, such as high order methods, space-time adaptive strategies, etc.
* High performance computing (HPC), such as parallel-in-time integration methods.
* High order numerical methods for PDEs.
