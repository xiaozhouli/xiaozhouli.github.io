> “The purpose of computation is insight, not numbers.” — Richard Hamming

My academic training is rooted in pure mathematics, with a strong focus on theoretical rigor. That foundation continues to inform my approach. However, in recent years, I have become increasingly drawn to computational mathematics as a bridge between mathematical insight and real-world complexity.

I am particularly interested in problems where high-level theory meets practical need—especially in the context of large-scale simulation, engineering-driven modeling, and high-performance computing. My work centers on the development of high-order numerical methods, such as discontinuous Galerkin schemes, and their application to complex coupled systems.

I believe that effective mathematical research balances depth and purpose. I value approaches that go beyond technical intricacy for its own sake, aiming instead for clarity, efficiency, and relevance in both design and application.


## Research Interests:
* **Numerical solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs):** Focus on high-order discretization methods such as the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for hyperbolic and convection-dominated problems.
* **Superconvergence and accuracy enhancement:** Rigorous theoretical analysis and development of post-processing techniques to improve solution accuracy and computational efficiency.
* **High-performance computing (HPC):** Scalable solvers, parallel-in-time algorithms, and integration with industrial simulation software for large-scale scientific computing.
* **Machine learning in numerical methods:** Incorporating deep learning for data-driven acceleration, adaptive modeling, and hybrid PDE-ML frameworks to enhance performance and predictive capability.
* **Coupled multi-physics simulations:** Design and analysis of robust and efficient numerical algorithms for complex multi-physics systems, emphasizing the synergy between mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, and HPC-driven implementation in engineering and scientific applications.
